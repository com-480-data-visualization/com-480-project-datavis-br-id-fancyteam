# Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

## Dataset

In our dataset explorations, we came across a dataset containing [Pokémon from Generations 1 to 6](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon). This dataset dates from 2016, so it does not contain Pokémon from more recent generations, namely 7 and 8. However, it seems to be relatively complete, and claims to use data from well-known sources such as [pokemon.com](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/), [pokemondb](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex) and [bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_National_Pok%C3%A9dex_number).

On its overview page, you can see that 800 unique values for names are provided, while the generations listed are supposed to contain [a total of 721 Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon#Detailed_lists_by_generation). If we compare with the unique identifiers, we indeed find 721. We will have to check whetever there is an issue with the names, or not.

The dataset offers many statistics to explore, including the types of Pokémon, some of their stats - although a lot of [extended statistics](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Statistic) exist - the number of their generation and their legendary status. The dataset itself states that perhaps more work should be done on the [Legendary status](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Legendary_Pok%C3%A9mon), to be compared to the [Mythical status](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mythical_Pok%C3%A9mon).

We will be able to compare this dataset not only with the cited sources, but also with other sources, such as [other, extended datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon). We will also be able to use image datasets, such as [that one (120x120px)](https://www.kaggle.com/vishalsubbiah/pokemon-images-and-types) or [that one (256x256px)](https://www.kaggle.com/kvpratama/pokemon-images-dataset), to complete our visualizations- and, why not, [use some 3D](https://all3dp.com/pokemon-3d-model/)!.

## Problematic

Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.

- What am I trying to show with my visualization?
- Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Pre-processing of the data set you chose:

- Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

## Related work


- What others have already done with the data?
- Why is your approach original?
- What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
- In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
